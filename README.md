# Arduino Time Attendance and Biometric Lock
This is a project inspired by many Time Attendance Systems [such as this one](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/arduino-time-attendance-system-with-rfid/), but with an extra layer of security trough biometric authentication. This project uses a RFID reader module, fingerprint sensor, SD card module, RTC module and a solenoid lock to be used as an electronic door lock . The schematic is available here:
